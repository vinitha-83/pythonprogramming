Tasks Performed 

Data Wrangling and Visualization for Ukraine-Russia War Impact Analysis - In this project, the goal is to perform comprehensive data wrangling and visualization on datasets related to the impact of the Ukraine-Russia war. The project is divided into distinct activities that involve programming with reusable functions, exploring datasets, sorting and analyzing data, and creating visual representations.


 Perform Data Wrangling Operations -The project kicks off with the development of a Python script or Jupyter notebook, incorporating reusable functions. Essential packages like NumPy, OS, Pandas, and Matplotlib are imported. The datasets are read, and their initial samples are displayed. Exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify and handle null values, potentially dropping columns with the highest null values. The dataset's description and dimensionality are presented for a comprehensive understanding.


Perform Data Sorting Operations -  This activity focuses on sorting the dataframe based on specific variables and indexing for analysis. Various sorting scenarios, including sorting by multiple columns, are explored. Additionally, indexing methods are used to extract single columns, and statistical analyses, such as calculating the average number of aircraft and determining the mean value and standard deviation after the 50th day, are performed. The relationship between columns is explored using the crosstab method.


 Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn -  The final activity delves into the visualization of the war impact dataset. The content of Dataset1 is explored, and columns associated with it are displayed. Line charts and scatter plots are employed to visualize the loss of air vehicles and various weapons, providing a clear visual representation of the dataset's patterns. Correlation analysis is conducted using a heatmap to identify relationships between different columns. The daily death toll is analyzed by plotting a histogram.


In summary, this project aims to equip data scientists with the skills to handle complex datasets related to war impact. Through data wrangling, sorting, and visualization techniques, meaningful insights are extracted to better understand the dynamics of the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
